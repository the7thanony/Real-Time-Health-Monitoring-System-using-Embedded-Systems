# ESP32-Based Health Monitoring System with Simulated Sensors
# Project Overview
This project implements a real-time health monitoring system using the ESP32 microcontroller, designed to track heart rate (pulse) and body temperature with emergency alert functionality. Built as a low-cost embedded system, it serves as a prototype for wearable medical devices, demonstrating how IoT and embedded systems can be used for remote patient monitoring.

Since this is a simulation-based project, it uses potentiometers to mimic medical sensor inputs, making it ideal for testing and development without requiring physical hardware. The system includes:

LCD display for real-time vital sign visualization

Buzzer & LED for emergency alerts

Wokwi simulator for virtual testing

The project is fully open-source, with Arduino-based firmware, making it easy to modify, extend, or integrate with real sensors in the future.

# Key Features
1. Simulated Health Monitoring
Pulse Rate (60â€“130 bpm):

Simulated using a potentiometer (GPIO14)

Random fluctuations mimic natural heart rate variability

Body Temperature (36.0â€“39.5Â°C):

Simulated via a second potentiometer (GPIO27)

Automatically adjusts with minor random variations

# 2. Emergency Alert System
Visual & Audio Warnings:

ðŸ”´ Red LED (GPIO2) lights up when thresholds are exceeded

ðŸ”” Buzzer (GPIO4) sounds at 1030Hz for critical alerts

Thresholds:

Pulse â‰¥ 100 bpm (tachycardia)

Temperature â‰¥ 38.0Â°C (fever)

# 3. Real-Time Data Display
16x2 I2C LCD Screen shows:

Copy
Pulse: 85 bpm  
Temp: 36.5Â°C  
Updates every second for continuous monitoring

# 4. Simulated "Danger Mode" (Testing Feature)
5% random chance to trigger high pulse/temperature

Tests the systemâ€™s alert response without manual input

# 5. IoT-Ready Architecture
ESP32â€™s built-in Wi-Fi/Bluetooth allows future cloud integration (e.g., ThingSpeak, Blynk)

Scalable design â€“ can replace potentiometers with real sensors (MAX30100, LM35)
